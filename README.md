# shifts-list
Creates a dict type with names as keys and time as values.
The time is the start time of each shift.
The list is created using a .csv file containing the names.
The user can choose to use an existing file or to create a new one by typing each name one after another.
The user can choose to use a "manual mode", a one-time-uesed list created on the spot manually by typing each name.
In the "manual mode" the list is not saved and can't be used later.
The list is shuffled randomaly (using the "Random" module).
